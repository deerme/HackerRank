Write a program that takes input of  integers N and M, followed by N more integers and then M more integers. For each of the last M numbers, the program outputs true, if that number was present in the array of N numbers, output False otherwise
(See https://www.programcreek.com/2014/04/check-if-array-contains-a-value-java/)
Constraints:
0 < N < 20,000
0<M<15,000

Your output lines should not have any trailing or leading whitespaces

Input
4 2
99 12 10 23
23
25

Output
True
False

Explanation: An input of size 4 is taken, followed by 2 lines. 23 outputs True, since 23 is present in above array, 25 outputs false because it was not in the array of N integers.
